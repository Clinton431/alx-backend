# 📥 Queuing System in JavaScript

A lightweight and extensible **Queuing System** built using vanilla JavaScript. This project provides a simple and robust queue management system that can be integrated into web applications, services, or backend JavaScript environments like Node.js.

## 📝 Overview

The **Queuing System** is designed to help manage tasks, messages, or events in a **first-in, first-out (FIFO)** manner. This is particularly useful in:

* Task scheduling
* Message brokering
* Print job management
* Support ticket handling
* Async job queues (e.g., in a backend system)

Built with extensibility and clarity in mind, this system can be enhanced to support priority queues, retry mechanisms, and persistent storage.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ FIFO Queue behavior
* ✅ Custom event handlers
* ✅ Queue size limit (optional)
* ✅ Asynchronous task handling
* ✅ Pausable and resumable queues
* ✅ Priority queue extension (optional)
* ✅ Works in both browser and Node.js environments

---

## 🛠️ Installation

### 📦 Using NPM (for Node.js)

```bash
npm install @your-username/js-queue-system
```

### 📁 Manual

Clone the repo and include `queue.js` in your project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/js-queue-system.git
```

Then add in your HTML:

```html
<script src="path/to/queue.js"></script>
```

---

## 📌 Usage

### Basic Example

```javascript
import Queue from './queue.js';

const queue = new Queue();

queue.enqueue(() => console.log('Task 1'));
queue.enqueue(() => console.log('Task 2'));

queue.process(); // Executes Task 1 and Task 2
```

### With Async Tasks

```javascript
queue.enqueue(async () => {
  await fetch('/api/data');
  console.log('Fetched data');
});
```

---

## 📖 API Reference

### `new Queue(options)`

Creates a new queue.

**Options:**

* `limit` (number): Optional. Max number of items allowed in queue.
* `autoStart` (boolean): Auto-process items on enqueue.

---

### `queue.enqueue(task)`

Adds a task (function or async function) to the queue.

**Returns**: `boolean` — `false` if queue is at capacity.

---

### `queue.process()`

Starts processing the queue.

---

### `queue.pause()`

Pauses the queue. Processing halts after the current task.

---

### `queue.resume()`

Resumes processing after a pause.

---

### `queue.clear()`

Empties the queue.

---

### `queue.size()`

Returns the number of items currently in the queue.

---

### `queue.isProcessing`

`true` if the queue is actively processing tasks.

---

## 💡 Examples

### Sequential Task Queue

```javascript
const queue = new Queue();

queue.enqueue(() => console.log('A'));
queue.enqueue(() => console.log('B'));
queue.enqueue(() => console.log('C'));

queue.process();
// Output: A B C
```

### Queue With Limits

```javascript
const queue = new Queue({ limit: 2 });

queue.enqueue(() => console.log('1')); // OK
queue.enqueue(() => console.log('2')); // OK
queue.enqueue(() => console.log('3')); // Ignored (limit reached)
```
